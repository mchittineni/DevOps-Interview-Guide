## Checklist

### Content

- [ ] Questions are recorded **as they were actually asked**, not rephrased into polished textbook wording
- [ ] This is a real interview, not a compiled "top questions" list from elsewhere
- [ ] No confidential material — no take-home problem statements under NDA, no internal system names, no proprietary architecture details
- [ ] No personal information about the interviewer (name, contact details, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Nothing identifying about the candidate beyond role and years of experience

### Frontmatter

- [ ] File starts with YAML frontmatter containing `company`, `role`, and `tags`
- [ ] `company` matches the folder name, or is `"Unknown"` for entries under `Others/`
- [ ] `topic/` tags come from the fixed 17-topic vocabulary in the README — no invented topics
- [ ] Tags reflect what the interview actually covered, not every tool you know

### Placement

- [ ] File is in the correct company folder under `docs/`, or under `docs/Others/` if the company can't be named
- [ ] Folder name matches the existing convention (underscores for spaces, e.g. `Morgan_Stanley`)
- [ ] Filename follows `<Role>.md`, numbered if a file for that role already exists (`DevOps_Engineer_2.md`)
- [ ] An existing file was **not** overwritten or merged into — separate interviews stay in separate files

### Formatting

- [ ] Ran `npx --yes markdownlint-cli2@0.23.2 --fix "**/*.md"` from the repo root
- [ ] Every code fence has a language tag (```` ```bash ````, ```` ```yaml ````, ```` ```text ````)
- [ ] Question numbering is intact and sequential — check this by eye after running the fixer
- [ ] The `Markdown Lint & Format` check passes on this PR

## Anything else

<!--
Optional. Useful things to mention:
  - the interview format (live coding, whiteboard, scenario-based, panel)
  - roughly how long each round ran
  - whether the questions leaned practical or theoretical
  - anything that surprised you
